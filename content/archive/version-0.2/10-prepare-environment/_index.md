## Setup your LearnFest Environment

For the Ansible LearnFest we use the [Ansible Automation Controller for Advanced Users](https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?labels=%7B%22product%22%3A%5B%22red_hat_ansible_automation_platform%22%5D%7D&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fsandboxes-gpte.automation-controller-advanced.prod) from RHPDS. If you run this workshop during Red Hat Tech Exchange, a lab was already created and details will be provided to you.

If you provision or order your own lab, make sure you enable the private automation hub.
